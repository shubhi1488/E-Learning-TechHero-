# E-Learning-TechHero-
E-Learning website(mini Project)


This is a E-Learning website named TechHero.
The purpose of this project is to develop a website for the B.Tech Computer 
science students who are in search for the good content to learn basic technologies 
like Data Structures & Algorithms, Web development etc. 
This website will provide some videos of the interviews conducted by some 
companies like Amazon, Google etc. and it will also contain a practice session 
containing frequently asked questions in placement rounds. 
The project is divided into 2 modules-student and administrator. The roles 
of the modules are as follows:

The student selects various courses available on the website. Students will 
get content related to the course which he/she has opted for from the basic to 
the advanced level . They will also have an access to the few online courses 
from various platforms like Udemy, coursera etc. Students can also test their 
skills from our practice section having questions directly asked in 
placements rounds. 
If any difficulty is faced by any user than they can directly contact to the 
concerned person.


Administrator:




Publish the content of various courses uploaded earlier and come with the 
course of new technology which is in demand in the IT sector and provide
